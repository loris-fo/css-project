#CSS Project



This repository shows my  work on a front-end project with the goal to create a webpage with a scroll effect!

I am going to recreate the same project in 3 different ways (The 3 projects will be visible on 3 different branches)


###Here are the differences I am going to implement in the different branches:

####Branch 1:

- Sinatra server

- Ruby will be the back-end language used

- Parallax will be used to create the scroll effect.

####Branch 2:

- Node server

- Javascript will be the back-end language used

- Parallax will be used to create the scroll effect.

####Branch 3:

- Node server

- Javascript will be the back-end language used

- Javascript/CoffeScript will be used to create the scroll effect.
